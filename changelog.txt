3.0.0

Major:
	New light mode, which works only on headers and latest blocks and is unable to stake - similar to 'light' clients offered by several other coins.
	New hybrid mode, which is something new to the crypto world, starts off by doing the equivalent of 'light' mode and then *rapidly* downloads the rest of the blockchain allowing the user to stake and be fully
	secure. A full blockchain download via this method is much faster than with a classic client.
    New 'classic' mode which is essentially the same as what previous wallets were.

Minor:
	IO: Fix regression in 2.2.2 - Clicking an account name in overview page was not jumping to transaction grid, it now does this properly again.
	CORE: Change console command "getbalance account" so that it returns a meaningful balance instead of always returning 0. (Only works on
	top level accounts for now)
	CORE: Change console command(s) "sendfrom" and "sendmany" to reuse new codebase and work in a more correct manner. They were incorrectly taking money from accounts other than the one specified in the command line.
	App: Default account created with name "My account" instead of no name when creating a new wallet.
	UI: Update icons and logo for cleaner look.
	UI: Tweak minimum size a little to prevent glitches with small window sizes.
	UI: Improve progress messages.
