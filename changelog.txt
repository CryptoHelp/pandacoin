Fix an issue that was leading to small font sizes on some OSX systems.
Make toolbar menu icons visible on OSX systems.
Initial translation of UI into zh_CN (Simplified Chinese).
New command line option -qm that can be used to give an abolute path to a .qm localistation file (generater by qt-linguist) - this is useful for UI translators who want to test their translations.
Speed improvement for 'verify' phase of hybrid syncing.
Fix an issue - for hybrid mode - that was causing invalid stakes for some users.
Improve some text/messages within UI and ensure text/messages that could not be localist can now be localised, to allow for full localisation by translators.
Allow translators to select the UI fonts they want used as each language should ideally have its own fonts rather than blindly using the same fonts.
Fix a UI issue with transaction grid 'summary header' whereby some of the balances would, in some instances, no longer be visible if shrinking a maximised window.
Replace pandachain.net with pnd.showed.us as blockchain explorer.
Fix an issue in 'transfer pane' where holding down the mouse over 'add another button' would incorrectly perform the action multiple times.
Fix some usability issues in transfer pane UI, inform user if trying to make a payment with no from address selected, better error message if balance is short due to staking and other minor changes.


3.0.0

Major:
	New light mode, which works only on headers and latest blocks and is unable to stake - similar to 'light' clients offered by several other coins.
	New hybrid mode, which is something new to the crypto world, starts off by doing the equivalent of 'light' mode and then *rapidly* downloads the rest of the blockchain allowing the user to stake and be fully
	secure. A full blockchain download via this method is much faster than with a classic client.
    New 'classic' mode which is essentially the same as what previous wallets were.

Minor:
	IO: Fix regression in 2.1.2 - Clicking an account name in overview page was not jumping to transaction grid, it now does this properly again.
	CORE: Change console command "getbalance account" so that it returns a meaningful balance instead of always returning 0. (Only works on top level accounts for now)
	CORE: Change console command(s) "sendfrom" and "sendmany" to reuse new codebase and work in a more correct manner. They were incorrectly taking money from accounts other than the one specified in the command line.
	App: Default account created with name "My account" instead of no name when creating a new wallet.
	UI: Update icons and logo for cleaner look.
	UI: Tweak minimum size a little to prevent glitches with small window sizes.
	UI: Improve progress messages.

2.1.2

Wallet no longer loses its staking status when doing an action that requires a full unlock, 'unlock for staking' is preserved across actions.
Add a right click context menu to portfolio overview so that account address can be easily copied.
Fix color issues on systems with 'non standard' color themes.
Cap the 'transaction fee' setting in options dialog at 100PND to prevent users accidentally setting it too high.
Fixes to transaction history in some problem cases where transaction history was incorrect.
Show fee transactions seperately so that transaction history is less confusing and more like a regular bank account.
Fix problem on rare machines where transaction view table would expand to infinite width.
Fix display issues with large account names.
Other minor UI tweaks.
